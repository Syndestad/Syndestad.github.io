subtitle: "The pondering postdoc"
description: "I am a breast cancer researcher working in a multidisciplinary environment where clinical science, molecular biology, data science and bioinformatic merges. Transitioning from a pure wet lab scientist into the realms of bioinformatics, required me to acquire a whole new skill set, including programming and statistics in R. I made this site to gather some of my how-to notes for future reference. I also hope that others working in translational research new to R may find it useful. Perhaps most importantly, I just wanted to learn how to make a website using R just for fun. This is it."
