description: "This is probably the quote that best describes how I ended up here. 
<br>
In the quest for getting 'the data' we do what it takes. Learn R, dive into statistics, data wrangling, sequencing formats, bash scripting, more statistics. Over time, 'Getting the data' always takes on different forms, because biology is messy and research questions evolves.
The upside is that I enjoy learning new methods. I also started to really enjoy working in R,  after the steep 'learning the basics' was done. 
So here I am, with a blog written in R about how to do stuff in R."
