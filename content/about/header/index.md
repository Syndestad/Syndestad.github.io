<!-- this is a subheadline -->


After my master on microbial genetic diversity in oil contaminated arctic tundra, I suddenly found myself working in a cancer research lab. 
There, in the "Breast Cancer Group" at Haukeland University Hospital, I did a PhD focusing on therapy resistance to anthracyclines and the PI3K-Akt-PTEN signaling pathway. In my PhD I also did functional studies on the PTEN pseudogene to illuminate its biology as a ceRNA, and it´s possible effect on tumor growth and effect on therapy. 
  

The rapid evolution of Next Generation Sequencing has made stuff possible that was pure science fiction during may master, opening up a new world of possibilities and problems to solve.
Transitioning from a pure wet lab scientist into the realms of bioinformatics, required me to acquire a whole new skill set, including programming and statistics in R.  

During my postdoc I was interested in therapy resistance in the context of DNA repair, and if faulty DNA repair in the tumor can predict if a patient responds to treatment or not. I worked with the phase 2 clincial trial PETREMAC during my entire PostDoc, doing 360 gene panel sequencing in matched tumor-blood samples, germline screening for pathogenic variants, building and maintaining the RNAseq pipeline with Dragen for WTS so that I could do i.e intrinsic subtyping and examine other gene signatures and cell type deconvolution from the gene expression data. I also worked with immunohistochemestry, established workflows for digital pathology for PD-L1 CPS score and other immune-markers. A great part of my time however, was also spent managing and organizing the clinical data from the PETREMAC trial, and doing statistics once the data was ready.

Currently I am working as a project-coordinator in a pink ribbon funded project focusing on the Arm A part of PETREMAC, the ER+ TP53wt patients.
The patients in arm A that did not respond to endocrine therapy was given Palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor.  
My aims during this project is to find predictive markers for response/resistance to Palbociclic.

The reason this webpage exists, is only because I thought that creating a webpage using R would be fun during the COVID lockdown.  
So I made this site directly as a result from the inspirational workshop on Hugo and Blogdown hosted by R-Ladies Bergen, and later the excellent workshop on Apéro hosted by R-Ladies Tunis. Getting together digitally during lock-down, made the world a brighter place.
So here I am, with a blog written in R, about doing stuff in R.
