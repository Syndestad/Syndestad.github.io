After my master on microbial genetic diversity in oil contaminated arctic tundra, I suddenly found myself working in a cancer research lab. 
There, in the "Breast Cancer Group" at Haukeland University Hospital, I did a PhD focusing on therapy resistance to anthracyclines and the PI3K-Akt-PTEN signaling pathway. In my PhD I also did functional studies on the PTEN pseudogene to illuminate its biology as a ceRNA, and it´s possible effect on tumor growth and effect on therapy. 
During my postdoc I was interested in therapy resistance in the context of DNA repair, and if faulty DNA repair in the tumor can predict if a patient responds to treatment or not. 
The rapid evolution of Next Generation Sequencing has made stuff possible that was pure science fiction during may master, opening up a new world of possibilities and problems to solve.
Transitioning from a pure wet lab scientist into the realms of bioinformatics, required me to acquire a whole new skill set, including programming and statistics in R.
Stay tuned to find out what happens now that those two worlds meet in my upcoming works.


This webpage exists because I thought that creating a webpage using R would be fun. So I made this site directly as a result from the inspirational workshop on Hugo and Blogdown hosted by R-Ladies Bergen, and later the excellent workshop on Apéro hosted by R-Ladies Tunis.
Getting together digitally during lock-down, made the world a brighter place.
