    This collage represent some of the methods and techniques I have used in the past.
    They are all from my lab-journals.  
    Some of it may find their way here, but I prefer to focus on the present, or the future.  
    
    Are you a clinical scientist, molecular biologist or similar that have all this data you want to analyze in R but don´t know how? 

    Don´t give up. The beginning is always the hardest.

    I have been there, and on the way I made a lot of "how to" notes.  
    Some of these "how-to" notes becomes blog-posts.   
    Hope you will find them useful.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
